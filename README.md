# CheckNumber
Hosting UIKit views in SwiftUI views.

*CheckNumber is an iOS application written in Swift, allowing users to interact with UIKit elements within a SwiftUI context. The user is presented with a slider that they must move as close as possible to a target value. The farther the slider is from the target, the more transparent the slider becomes. Pressing the "Check me!" button reveals an alert showing the score.*

**Tech Stack**

- Swift
- SwiftUI

- MVVM

**Features**

- Random Value Generation: The app generates a random target value and initial slider position.
- Score Display: Upon pressing the "Check me!" button, an alert is displayed with the current score.
- Interactive Slider: The slider can be moved and its transparency changes depending on its proximity to the target value.
- The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which ensures clear separation of the data, user interface, and application logic.
